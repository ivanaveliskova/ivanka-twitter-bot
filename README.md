# ivanka-twitter-bot

## This is the repo and code sample for my twitter bot.

Currently the bot (@IvankaBot) listens through the Twitter Streaming API for any @ mentions, if the phrase contains the word 'hello', 'hi', or 'hey', then it will tweet back at you with a randomly chosen phrase from 15 preset choices.
